Project Summary
This project is designed to replicate what you might receive on the job. There won't be any guided instruction on what you'll need to do. We will only provide you with design specifications and technical requirements. Your mentors have also been asked to provide only minimal guidance. They can point you in the right direction, but cannot help you code. This project is a chance for you to combine and showcase the skills you've learned so far.

With this specification/requirement only structure, we believe this project will showcase what you can do as an individual and how you can work with a team at this point of the program. Because of this, we feel this project will be worth putting in your portfolio.

After completing the project, host your project on https://zeit.co/ and provide your mentor with the link.

Good luck and work hard!
